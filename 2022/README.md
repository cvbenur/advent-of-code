# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code - 2022

[ðŸ“… Go back to year list](../README.md).

The challenges for the year 2022 can all be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022/).

For this year, my goal is to solve each challenge using only (or as much as possible) functional programming in JS. You can find out more about all that [right here](https://www.toptal.com/javascript/functional-programming-javascript).

I have sorted all my answers by day.
